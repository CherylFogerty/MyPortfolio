            <p> My name is Cheryl Fogerty, you can call me Cher, welcome to my page!
              For 22 years I worked as a Broadcast Technician for KSDK,
              a local tv station in St. Louis MO until I was laid off in December 2020.
              During my tenure at KSDK I worked in every aspect of the Broadcast
              industry from production to operations. Upon being laid off I decided
              to make a career change and learn computer coding and web design.
              This page is my first attempt at a new start, I hope you enjoy the
              content as much as I enjoyed making it. Thank you for stopping by.
            </p>
