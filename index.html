    <h3>About Me:</h3>
    <p> My name is Cheryl Fogerty, you can call me Cher, welcome to my page! 
        For 22 years I worked as a Broadcast Technician for KSDK, 
        a local tv station in St. Louis MO until I was laid off in December 2020.
        During my tenure at KSDK I worked in every aspect of the Broadcast
        industry from production to operations. Upon being laid off I decided
        to make a career change and learn computer coding and web design. 
        This page is my first attempt at a new start, I hope you enjoy the
        content as much as I enjoyed making it. Thank you for stopping by.
